## User Story

As a person who is indecisive on whether to go out or cook at home.
I want to be able to quickly lookup a cuisine and be presented with a list of local restaurants serving said cuisine and a list of recipes I can make at home.
So that I can decide whether I want to eat out or cook a meal at home.

## Description

The motivation for this project was to assist users who are indecisive about what they want to eat and whether or not they want to eat out or cook at home. If the user were to choose out and a specified cuisine, they would be shown restaurants that serve their desired cuisine. If the user were to choose in and spcify a cuisine, they would be presented with a list of dishes that could be cooked at home. This way no matter whether they decide to eat out or dine in they'll have options.

During this project we learned: 
- how to style an html using Bulma
- how to create and implement modals
- how to call and access data from an API
- how to link multiple html pages in one application
- The importance of reading documentation]]

## Usage

When the page is opeened, the user if presented with a dropdown menu with different cuisines, a text area to input a city, and two buttons labeled " Dine in" or "Dine out". If the user does not select a cuisine or a city, they will be given an alert that tells them they need to select a city and cuisine. After the user chooses a cuisine and inputs a city they will choose to dine in or out. If the user clicks the dine in button, they are taken to a new page. This page will display recipes based on the cuisine the user chose. If the user clicks the dine out button, they are brought to a new page. This page will display a list of restaurants in teh city they they chose that serve food based on teh cuisine they chose. They are also presented with an image of the restaurant, the restaurants address, and a rating that is out of 5 for the restarurant.
